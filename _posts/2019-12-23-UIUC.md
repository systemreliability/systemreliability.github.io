## Details of the work at National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)

From December 23, 2019, Youngjun Kwon and I have started our two-month research visit at the NCSA at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) with the support of the EDRC Research Intern Program (Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, S. Korea).
During the visit, we study the ongoing research of the institution, called [Interdependent Networked Community Resilience Modeling Environment](https://incore.ncsa.illinois.edu/) (IN-CORE), with the help of Dr. Jong Lee and Chen Wang.

## Application
