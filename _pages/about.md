**Dr. Dongkyu Lee** received his B.S. and Ph.D. in Civil & Environmental Engineering from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) (SNU). After working as a postdoctoral researcher at [SNU](https://icee.snu.ac.kr/) (2023-2024) and [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) (TUM) (2024-2025), he joined [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en) (UNITN) as a **Postdoctoral researcher**.

He has a broad academical background in **Graph theory**, **Deep reinforcement learning**, **Bayesian network**, **Variance-reduction techniques** (importance sampling, subset simulation, ...), and so on. He is interested in:

- Reliability analysis of urban systems/networks under seismic uncertainties
- Risk-informed maintenance strategies for lifeline networks
- Application of statistical/machine learning techniques for urban infrastructure systems

He has presented [his research outcomes](/publications/) through 5 papers published in peer-reviewed archival journals, and 21 conference/workshop presentations (7 domestic, 14 international).
